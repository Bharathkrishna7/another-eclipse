BASIC TESTNG ANNOTATIONS SEQUENCE:-

@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod
@AfterClass
@AfterTest
@AfterSuite
.............................................
*Here @Test is nothing but an "TestCase".
*Whenever we run a program with "lot of @Test annotations" @Test Run in b/w 
      @BeforeMethod & @AfterMethod ....
*@BeforeTest executes beforetestTage "EX:-<test name=" ">" in 'Xml'..
*@BeforeMethod executes before and After the @Test annotation  in program..

1.*In @Test annotation we can do "grouping" Ex:-@Test(groups = "validdetails") it can divid's testcases..

2.*if they are 4 testcases like
EX:-@Test()
==>public void login()
   @Test()
==>public void userdetails(dependsonMethods="login")
   @Test()
==>public void search(dependsonMethods="login")
   @Test()
==>public void address(dependsonMethods="login")
>> if we write like this.if login fails remaining testCases will 
    atomatically skiped bec of "dependsonMethods keyword".. 
    
 3.*if we want to execute a testcase morethan one time we can use a keyword called "invocationcount"
  Ex:-@Test(invocationCount=4), now it will execute 4 times. 
  
 4.*In testng to handle exceptions without using "try catch" in this form.. 
  >>@Test(expectedException=NumberFormatException.class) 
  >>@Test(expectedException=ArrayIndexoutofbounsException.class)
    
 5.* Execute Xml file with lot of testng classes 
 
    <suite name="Automation suite">
    
       <test name="Different testing features">
       
         <classes>
              <class name="com.Cname"/>
              <class name="com.Cname"/> 
              <class name="com.Cname"/> 
              <class name="com.Cname"/> 
         </classes>
       </test>
     </suite>             
    
6. * We can write parameters in "xml" pages.
   
   Ex:-<parameter name="url" value="https://www.flipkart.com/"/>      
    
   ** We can write "Generic parameters" only like "Url,Uname,Password".
   *We can also write test data but it is not good practice to do that. 
   
7.How does TestNG run parallel classes?
In the above testng. xml file, we have defined two attributes 'parallel' and 'thread-count' at suite level. 

As we want classes to be executed in parallel, we have provided 'parallel="classes''. And 'thread-count' attribute 

is to used to pass the number of maximum threads to be created.
